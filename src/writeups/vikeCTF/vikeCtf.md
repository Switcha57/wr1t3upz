# vikeCTF writeups 

hi these are all the challenges that me "f1r3k3rn" and our team "M0NT3C4RL0" did in this ctf , make sure to star this repo and if u want vote our writeups .

Why? it's 11pm , I'm writing in markdown , I want to die because I have university tomorrow and i want some stars on github **uwu**.

**P.S** I don't know if I can write them all in these 2 hours if you see links that don't work it's because I'll finish them tomorrow
